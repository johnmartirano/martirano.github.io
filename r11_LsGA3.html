<h2>Avant Garde Entices Oberlin With Mixed-Media 'L'sGA'</h2>
<h5><i>An article by Wilma Salisbury.</i></h5>

<hr>

<p>"Blow your mind (and 50c) on the mixed media concert in Finney Chapel," suggest signs presently posted on the Oberlin College campus.</p>

<p>Featured on the avant-garde program tonight at 8:30 will be a staged performance of "L's GA" ("Lincoln's Gettysburg Address") by Salvatore Martirano, a theater peice for gas-masked politicos, helium bomb, three movie projectors and two-channel tape recorder.</p>

<p>Describing his notorious composition to a group of Oberlin students yesterday, Martirano said, "It starts with eight minutes of low sound that actually vibrates the floor (you get a massage), and ends with an organ version of 'My heart at thy sweet voice' from 'Samson and Delilah.'  It gives a very exalted feeling."</p>

<p>The 24-minute piece, the composer explained, also incorporated Lincoln's speech recited in several dialects, films of faces, flowers, tongues and other things, and electronic sound from 24 speakers.</p>

<p>"It's not too loud for people who are accustomed to rock," he said.</p>

<p>The original impetus for "L's GA," which also exists in recorded and filmed versions, came from a lecture Martirano heard opposing the use of political subjects in art works.  So negative was the former Marine's reaction that he decided to write a work showing that "it could be done."</p>

<p>Completed in 1968, the piece has received 35 performances in a variety of geographical locations and physical environments.</p>

<p>The audience reaction is different every time," Martirano said.  "At the Electric Circus in New York, people were shouting and cheering.  But in Portland, Ore., they just sat there, stunned."</p>

<p>Martirano reports, however, that his music has never stimulated violent responses.</p>

<p>"I try to make connections with the audience," he said.  "I start with something they know - texts by Lincoln, Shakespeare, Dante - and then translate word inflections into many different sounds.  Generally, people like my music - because it's easy."</p>

<p>Martirano's career as a composer began more than 20 years ago when he was a student of Herbert Elwell at Oberlin.  After completing his undergraduate degree, he attended the Eastman School of Music where he studied with Bernard Rogers.  He then received a Fulbright fellowship to Italy where he worked with Luigi Dallapiccola.</p>

<p>Numerous fellowships, grants, awards and commissions followed.  And today as composer-in-residence at the University of Illinois, Martirano is securely entrenched in the university complex, which he regards as "a very enlightened place to be."</p>

<p>To an impressive list of compositions for orchestra, chamber ensemble, chorus, voice, electronic tape and mixed media, Martirano will soon add a new work scored for large orchestra, controller and bunny.</p>
