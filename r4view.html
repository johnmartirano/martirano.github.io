<h3>First Of Synthesizers</h3><h2>
Instrument's Father Ready To Sell 'Son'</h2>

<p>A red glow shows a maze of twisted wires.  Lights from 291 buttons blink on - then off.  Salvatore Martirano hovers over the silver panel, his fingers lightly touching tiny knobs, bringing the ear-splitting noise to a crescendo or fading to the sound of water dripping from a rain gutter.</p>

<p>Martirano, professor of music at the University of Illinois, controls the ominous electronic music with the finesse of a symphony orchestra conductor.</p>

<p>The machine, a hybrid digital-analogue musical-compositional instrument, is the offspring of an era of electronic vibrations of which SAL-MAR (dubbed after its inventor) was the first of its kind.</p>

<p>Martirano, the true father of the synthesizer, is putting his beloved son up for sale.  Between $18,000 and $20,000 was spent from his personal savings and salary in putting the machine together.</p>

<p>He said he was tired of his toy, which uses less electricity than a light bulb.  "Most composers do a piece and then another and the first one fades in interest, said Martirano, now on commission to compose an orchestration for the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra.</p>

<p>Although the technology in SAL-MAR is now obsolete, when first conceived in 1969 and completed in 1972 as a University of Illinois project, the synthesizer was electronically unique.</p>

<p>SAL-MAR bypasses mass storage input-output which was inefficient, costly and inhibitive of real-time response.  Most digital, computer-produced sound does not produce real-time, meaning the sound is not produced at the time the note is played.</p>

<p>Computers must be programmed so it takes an hour of computer time for one minute of music, Martirano said.  "This makes a difference as far as performer feedback is concerned," he explained.</p>

<p>With 24 strategically placed speakers around the den where SAL-MAR is located, the machine can produce sound traffic, throwing high-pitched buzzing across the room from one speaker to the other.</p>

<p>"SAL-MAR is doing what a conductor surrounded by 90 players is doing.  There are thousands of possible combinations that are predetermined," Martirano said.  There are a finite number of combinations, but too many for him to count.</p>

<p>One note can be played at a time by using manual programming.  Sequences are obtained by automatic programming.</p>

<p>"The concept is that the performer can change his distance from actual control over the event.  You play a piano note, those notes come out.  SAL-MAR eliminates this one-to-one control.  The performer is not making the sound," Martirano said.</p>

<p>Sequences may be repeated but the performer would have to touch each button at exactly the same second to obtain the same sounds.</p>

<p>Martirano, who performs in campus towns throughout the United Sates, said SAL-MAR eliminates rehearsal.  It also takes only two weeks to learn to operate it while a piano may take 10 to 12 years, he said.</p>

<p>Martirano stresses that SAL-MAR is more a composition tool than an instrument.  "It's not an entity in itself.  One may compose and then take the idea.  But it eliminates the paper and pencil," he said.</p>

<p>Despite its demise as an electronic wonder, SAL-MAR still marks the beginnig of composition sythesizers, reflecting that Martirano calls the interaction between humans and electronics.</p>
